# Underbar Review

A few simple exercises to review implementation and usage of the Underbar (Underscore) utility library in JavaScript. Start by working on the 'master' branch--if you need any hints I have dropped them into the 'hint' branch. Solutions included on the 'solution' branch if you want to compare against my code.

Happy coding! :beers:
